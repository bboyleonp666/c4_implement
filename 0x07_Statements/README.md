# Statements
There are 6 statements in this self-hosting C compiler
1. `if (...) <statement> [else <statement>]`
1. `while (...) <statement>`
1. `{ <statement> }`
1. `return xxx;`
1. `<empty statement>;`
1. `<expression>;` (expression ends with semicolon)

This script is still not compilable due to `expression()` is not implement yet.
