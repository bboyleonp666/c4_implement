# C in four functions implement
This is the self-hosting C compiler implementation  
Inspired by [rswier/c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) and [lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter)

The implementation starts from 0x01 while 0x00 is clone from [rswier/c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4).  
This implementation are all re-typed by myself without any copy and paste, in order to understand the behavior of a compiler and self-hosting.
